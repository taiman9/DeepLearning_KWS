# DeepLearning_KWS
Deep Learning project to train and implement keyword spotting models for on-device speech command inference. I used Tensorflow's open source speech commands recognition framework to develop and configure code for implementing and evaluating my keyword spotting models for edge deployment. Please read my 'Project_report' in this directory for details about my implementation and findings. The set of keywords currently configured for model training are in the file 'labels.txt'. The 'speech_commands' directory contains the code files. Please view the README file in the 'speech_commands' directory for inctructions to train and evaluate my model as well as the baseline model.
