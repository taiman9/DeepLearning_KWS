# DeepLearning_KWS
Deep Learning project to train and implement keyword spotting models for on-device speech command inference. I used Tensorflow's open source speech commands recognition framework to develop and configure code for implementing and evaluating my keyword spotting models for edge deployment. The `Project_report` file in this directory contains details about my implementation and findings. The set of keywords currently configured for model training are in the file `labels.txt`. The `speech_commands` directory contains the code files, and some results I obtained. Please view the README file in the `speech_commands` directory for inctructions to train and evaluate my model as well as the baseline model.
